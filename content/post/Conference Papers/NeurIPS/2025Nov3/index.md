We are delighted to announce that our paper, “Brittleness and Promise: Knowledge Graph Based Reward Modeling for Diagnostic Reasoning,” has been accepted to the [GenAI4Health workshop at NeurIPS 2025](https://genai4health.github.io/)!

In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) by framing our problem as reward modeling over KG paths. This framing is motivated by a fundamental observation in computational theory, which states that verifying a solution is often easier than generating one from scratch.

We examine five different task formulations and train models using various techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, preference alignment, and chain-of-thought distillation. While we observe promising results for task-specific formulations, we also notice brittleness in terms of generalizability.

This research is a collaboration with:
  - Dr. Majid Afshar (University of Wisconsin–Madison)
  - Dr. Dmitriy Dligach (Loyola University Chicago)

Join us for the lightning talk! Saksham Khatwani will present our work on December 6. 
Slides and code will be released soon. Stay tuned!
