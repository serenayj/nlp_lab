We’re excited to announce that our paper **Anchored Answers: Unravelling Positional Bias in GPT-2's Multiple-Choice Questions** on has been accepted to an upcoming ACL 2025! 

In this study, we investigate how GPT-2 internally represents and reasons over Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQA) tasks. Our analysis uncovers shortcut behaviors, **positional heuristics** that influence how the model selects answers—even when those answers appear superficially correct.

By conducting **neuron- and circuit-level analysis**, we shed light on how LLMs process structured prompts, where hidden biases emerge. This work contributes to our broader goal of developing **safe, interpretable, and trustworthy AI systems** in general domain NLP.

This is a collaboration with Prof. Ruizhe Li from University of Aberdeen. 

Slides and code will be shared soon—stay tuned!
