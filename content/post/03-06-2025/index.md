We are excited to announce the launch of our Reinforcement Learning (RL) Seminar, a biweekly reading and discussion series focused on foundational RL concepts and applications.

With several ongoing RL-related projects in our lab and a growing need for structured training among our trainees, we are introducing this seminar-style reading club to foster a deeper understanding of RL principles.

**Who Can Join?**
This seminar is open to anyone interested in reinforcement learning, whether you're a beginner or already working on RL research. No prior experience is required—just curiosity and enthusiasm! Note that we are currently limiting to trainees, staffs and faculty in CU Anschutz.  

Seminar Details
📅 Start Date: March 18, 2025
📖 Format: Reading + discussion (see the full schedule [here](https://github.com/LARK-NLP-Lab/Reinforcement_Learning_Seminar))
