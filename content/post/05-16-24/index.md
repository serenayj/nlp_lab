We are thrilled to announce that our paper, "Learning to Maximize Mutual Information for Chain-of-Thought Distillation," has been accepted to the prestigious Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) 2024 conference as a Findings paper!  <!--more-->

This is a joint work with Dr. Xin Chen at Applied ML Lab, Intel Corp., and final year PhD student Hanxian Huang at UCSD. 

We are eagerly looking forward to presenting our findings at ACL 2024 and engaging with the community. We believe our work will spark valuable discussions and inspire further research in the field of NLP.

For those interested in a deeper dive, the preprint of our paper is already available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03348). We welcome feedback and discussions from fellow researchers and practitioners.

Thank you for your continued support and interest in our work. Stay tuned for more updates and insights as we prepare for the conference!
