Dr. Yanjun Gao recently spoke at a campus conference on "Engaging with AI", where she shared insights on the evolving role of AI in research, healthcare, and education. The talk explored how AI innovations, particularly large language models (LLMs), are transforming scientific discovery and decision-making.

A key focus of the discussion was on responsible AI development, ensuring that AI systems are transparent, explainable, and aligned with human needs. Dr. Gao also highlighted the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in shaping the future of AI, bridging advances in natural language processing (NLP) with real-world applications in clinical decision support and knowledge discovery.

Our lab's recent work was featured in this tak, focusing on [long document summarization with temporal reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18724). We found that existing LLMs, depiste their promising performance on single documents summarization, suffers poor performance on three clinical summarization tasks. This indicates the need of further improving the LLMs capabilities.
