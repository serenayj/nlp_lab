# General Instructions for Giving a Job Talk at LARK Lab

At LARK Lab, we value engaging discussions, deep technical insights, and collaborative learning. A job talk is an opportunity for us to learn about your research, thought process, and how you approach problems. Below are general guidelines to help you prepare for your talk:

## 1. Structure of the Job Talk
Your presentation will be divided into two main components:

### **Research Project Introduction (20 minutes)**
- Present one of your favorite research projects.
- Clearly articulate the problem, why it matters, and how your approach addresses it.
- Highlight key methodologies, results, and broader impact.
- If applicable, discuss any open questions or future directions.

### **Paper Presentation (30 minutes)**
- We will provide you with a research paper in advance.
- Present the key insights, technical contributions, and broader implications of the paper.
- We expect you to go into a certain level of technical depth while also making the high-level idea clear.
- Discuss how this paper connects to your research interests and how you might draw inspiration from it.
- Share your professional opinion—whether you find it insightful, flawed, or thought-provoking, as long as you provide well-reasoned justifications.

## 2. Expectations and Best Practices
- **Clarity and Depth:** While technical rigor is important, we also value clarity. Ensure your presentation is accessible while still maintaining depth.
- **Details Matter**: Details matter. You don't need to present all details (present the critical details), but "devils in the details" has a reasoning—you need to be familiar with the details as if you wrote and implemented them.
- **Use of External Resources:** You are welcome to use online resources (e.g., YouTube videos, ChatGPT, blog posts) to enhance your understanding of the paper. We appreciate candidates who can effectively leverage tools to learn quickly and synthesize insights.
- **Critical Thinking:** We are looking for an active thinker—someone who not only engages with ideas but also critiques them, connects them to broader research themes, and sparks new discussions.
- **Broader Context:** If possible, explore related work and position the paper within the field.
- **Code Exploration (Optional but Encouraged):** If time permits, diving into the code implementation of the paper can be a great way to gain deeper insights.


## 3. Interactive Discussion
- Expect questions throughout your presentation. We appreciate open-ended discussions where we can learn from each other.
- Be prepared to discuss how your expertise and research interests align with LARK Lab’s focus areas.
- If relevant, share thoughts on how your work could contribute to ongoing projects or inspire new directions in the lab.

## Final Thoughts
We value intellectual curiosity, collaboration, and the ability to convey complex ideas effectively. Your job talk is not just about presenting research; it’s an opportunity for us to engage in meaningful discussions and envision how you would contribute to our lab’s research environment.

We look forward to your presentation and an engaging conversation!
